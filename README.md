# Output-Comparing-Script
This bash script compares the expected output with the output given by your cpp program. This was created to quickly run and compare the outputs, identify the set of inputs for which my code failed (if any) during competitive programing contest where time is of the utmost importance. 

How to use?
Place the script.sh file in your repo containing the cpp file. Copy the input and their corresponding expected output to two txt files. Run 'bash script.sh name_of_your_cpp_file.cpp input_file_name.txt output_file_name.txt' on your terminal (without ' (single inverted comma) ofc).
